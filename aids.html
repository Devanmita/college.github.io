  <h1>Artificial Intelligence And Data Science</h1>
  <p>The Artificial Intelligence and Data Science (AI-DS) is an interdisciplinary field that combines Computer Science, Mathematics and Statistics to create intelligent System that can learn from data. The main goal of the department is to develop algorithms, tools and techniques that enable machines to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence such as language understanding, Image recognition and decision making. The department utilizes Machine Learning,Natural Language Processing, Deep learning other advanced technologies to build intelligent systems that can make predictions, analyze data and automate process</p>
    <p>Data Science is an interdisciplinary field that combines statistics, scientific computing, scientific methods, processes, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data. It involves the use of specialized programming languages, advanced analytics, artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and specific subject matter expertise to uncover actionable insights hidden in an organizationâ€™s data. These insights can be used to guide decision-making and strategic planning. The data science lifecycle involves various roles, tools, and processes that enable analysts to glean actionable insights. Typically, a data science project undergoes the following stages: Data ingestion, Data storage and data processing, Data analysis, and Communication.</p>
