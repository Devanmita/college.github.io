  <h1>Computer Science And Engineering</h1>
  <p>Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) is an academic program that combines the scientific and engineering aspects of computing. It is offered at many universities worldwide, including India. CSE is an umbrella term that encompasses a wide range of topics, including computer science, computer engineering, and electrical engineering.

    The primary objective of CSE is to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of the fundamental principles of computing and their applications in various fields. The curriculum includes courses in programming, algorithms and data structures, computer architecture, operating systems, computer networks, parallel computing, embedded systems, algorithms design, circuit analysis and electronics, digital logic and processor design, computer graphics, scientific computing, software engineering, database systems, digital signal processing, virtualization, computer simulations and games programming 2.
    
    CSE programs also cover core subjects of theoretical computer science such as theory of computation, numerical methods, machine learning, programming theory and paradigms 2. Modern academic programs also cover emerging computing fields like image processing, data science, robotics, bio-inspired computing, computational biology, autonomic computing and artificial intelligence </p>
    <p>Most CSE programs require introductory mathematical knowledge. Hence the first year of study is dominated by mathematical courses such as discrete mathematics, mathematical analysis, linear algebra, probability and statistics as well as the basics of electrical and electronic engineering, physics and electromagnetism 2.

        After completing a degree program in CSE, candidates can find various entry-level jobs in the IT industry or related fields. Some popular job roles include software developer, CSE engineer, web developer and hardware engineer .</p>
