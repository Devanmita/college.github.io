  <h1>Artificial Intelligence And Robotics</h1>
  <p>Artificial intelligence and robotics are two related but distinct fields of engineering that study and create intelligent systems for various applications. Artificial intelligence is a branch of computer science that simulates the workings of the human brain. Robotics is a domain that involves mechanical, electrical, and computer engineering to design and control robots or machines. Some people consider robotics to be a subset of artificial intelligence, while others see them as compatible but separate branches. Robotics dates back to 1898, when Nikola Tesla remotely directed a robot boat using radio waves5. Artificial intelligence and robotics have been used for decision support, perception, learning, planning, reasoning, interaction, and physical and virtual environments.</p>
    <p>Robotics is a separate entity in Artificial Intelligence that helps study the creation of intelligent robots or machines. Robotics combines electrical engineering, mechanical engineering and computer science & engineering as they have mechanical construction, electrical component and programmed with programming language. Although, Robotics and Artificial Intelligence both have different objectives and applications, but most people treat robotics as a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Robot machines look very similar to humans, and also, they can perform like humans, if enabled with AI.</p>
